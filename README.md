# 🔥 Landmine Sniffer

A rugged, sensor-packed tactical robot designed for **real-time landmine detection**, **environmental monitoring**, **live surveillance**, and **Wi-Fi-based electronic attacks**.

Built for **defense & field recon**, this tank integrates multiple sensors, wireless tech, and offensive capabilities into one compact platform.

## 🧠 System Overview

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Metal Detector** | Detects buried landmines using electromagnetic induction. |
| 📍 **GPS Module (Neo-7M)** | Sends precise coordinates when a landmine is detected. |
| 🌡️ **DHT11 Sensor** | Monitors basic humidity and temperature to assess terrain conditions. |
| ☠️ **MQ-5 Gas Sensor** | Detects flammable and hazardous gases (for chemical/bio threat detection). |
| 🎥 **ESP32-CAM (with Buck-Boost Converter)** | Streams live video from the tank. Converter ensures stable voltage for the cam. |
| 📶 **ESP8266 (ESP-07)** | Used for **Wi-Fi Deauthentication** and **Flooding Attacks** (jamming enemy communication). |
| 🧠 **ESP32 Dev Board** | Acts as the main controller for sensor data, video streaming, and communication. |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Metal Detector** detects underground landmines.
2. **ESP32** gets **GPS data** from Neo-7M and logs location.
3. **DHT11** and **MQ-5** sensors monitor environmental safety.
4. **ESP32-CAM** streams live visuals using a regulated power supply (buck-boost).
5. **ESP8266** performs **Deauth / Wi-Fi flood attacks** for disrupting enemy networks.
